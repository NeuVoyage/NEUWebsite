                                    Genetic modification has paved the way toward many things in the 23rd Century: medical breakthroughs, personal enhancements, exotic pets, and the largest hotbed of crime and underground activity the country has ever seen. Many groups seek to tame the Wild West of technology, and not all of them with good intent. Your mods make you powerful, and the rumbles of unrest have created unprecedented opportunity to change the direction of progress. This summer, the first release of our upcoming RPG system will bring the future to a tabletop near you. 

                                    <br> <br>

                                    The campaigns we'll release to accompany this system share a world with our animated series, coming toward the end of 2019. New Paris is a comedy noir rollercoaster through the complicated life of a sex icon turned detective.  Check out our info pages to learn about New Paris, the biggest city of 23rd century America, and how you can help with its construction.
